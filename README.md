Compute dance tournament scores using "The Skating System."

Documentation for scoring system can be found in https://www.worlddancesport.org/Document/99473179446/The_Skating_System.pdf

The only way to run this now is using the unit tests:
```
$ python -m pytest
```

If someone wants to use this for real, you'll have to come up with a way to input parameters, score them, and output the results.
